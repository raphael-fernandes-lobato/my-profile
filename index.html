  <h2>Race</h2>
   <p>Running is in my blood. Since I was a little car I have been a fan of racing, which led me to become a race car. I trained harder than anyone else to reach my goal: to win the Piston Cup!

  <h2>Radiator Spring</h2>
  <p>
	Radiator Spring is my safe place. There is nowhere else I feel better than in this little town on Route 66. Located in the middle of Arizona, the charm of this town is cultivated by its inhabitants who quickly become more than friends: they are my crew, the only people I can count on. It doesn't look like much, but this town has had some of the funniest and most unlikely stories in the United States.

  <h2>Trips</h2>
  <p>Throughout my career, I have not stopped traveling. I've been all over the United States, I've even been to Japan, Italy and England but it was in Radiator Springs that I discovered the pleasure of riding. With Sally, I did a lot of riding and discovered the beauty of the area. Now I love it so much that I went on a road trip with my friend Mater. You can find all our adventures on Disney+!</p>
